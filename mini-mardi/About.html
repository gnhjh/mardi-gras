                        serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                        Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before
                        becoming mayor, Cantrell
                        represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.[1][2]</p>

                    <p class="P-style-about">Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor
                        neighborhood. In 2003, she
                        joined the board of the
                        Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004.[4] After the
                        2005 levee failures in
                        Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and
                        remained mostly
                        deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a
                        blue-ribbon panel convened by
                        then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New
                        Orleans neighborhoods to be
                        converted into greenspace.[5][6] In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked
                        with residents and local
                        religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist
                        returning Broadmoor
                        residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.[7]

                        Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                        fellow residents formed
                        the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson
                        school.[8] She served as a
                        founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development
                        corporation that provided case
                        management and other social services for returning residents.[9] She was involved with
                        residents' efforts to reopen
                        Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie
                        Endowment.[10] She created a
                        partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which
                        provided the
                        neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups.[11] She also formed a
                        partnership between the
                        Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open
                        the Broadmoor Art and
                        Wellness Center.[12]</p>

                    <p class="P-style-about">
                        Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans
                        in 1990 to attend Xavier University of
                        Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology.[3] She attended an executive training program at
                        the Harvard Kennedy
                        School.

                    <p class="P-style-about">
                        The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of
                        the Epiphany, also called Twelfth Night or
                        Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.

                        Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our
                        private Carnival clubs,
                        called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers.
                        Visitors quickly learn to
                        say, "Throw me something mister!"

                        The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social
                        Aid & Pleasure Club and
                        the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the
                        fun-filled day of excitement
                        for revelers of all ages.

                        New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place
                        to be at any time of
                        the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your
                        plans now to be a part
                        of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"

                    <p class="P-style-about">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the
                        city of New Orleans.
                        Celebrations are
                        concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                        (the start of lent in
                        the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                        permitting); many days have
                        several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of
                        the Mardi Gras season. In
                        the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
                        parades and balls (some
                        of them masquerade balls).

                        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                        parade schedule and route
                        each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex,
                        the Knights of Momus and
                        the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                        events (often featuring
                        celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu
                        Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a
                        predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds.
                        The most common throws are
                        strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and
                        small inexpensive toys.
                        Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                        While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                        originate in the Uptown and
                        Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver
                        side of the French
                        Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place
                        downtown in the Faubourg
                        Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day
                        traditionally concludes with the
                        "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.[1]
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="H2-style-about">Traditional colors</h2>
                    <p class="P-style-about">The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are
                        purple, green, and gold.
                        The colors were first
                        specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade
                        in 1872, suggesting that
                        balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were
                        chosen; some accounts
                        suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any
                        true symbolism.[38][39]

                        Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a
                        theory that the colors were
                        based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have
                        been to create a tricolor
                        to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already
                        heavily used on other
                        national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and
                        purple in that order complies
                        with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or
                        next to other colors, and
                        that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[38]

                        Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                        themed around the
                        concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order
                        symbolized justice, power, and
                        faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that
                        order—even though this order
                        technically violates the rule of tincture.[38][40
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="H2-style-about">Costumes and masks</h2>
                    <p class="P-style-about">In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe
                        members on the days
                        before Fat Tuesday (other
                        than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity
                        with a mask are
                        suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security
                        concerns (such as
                        convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.
